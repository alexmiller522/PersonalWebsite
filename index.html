Hello! My name is Alexandra Miller and I am currently a Freshman at Appalachian State University. My intended major is Computer Science with a minor of Mathematics. During the past year I received an award from the National Center for Women and Information Technology for Aspirations in Technology and an award for Excellence in Computer Science presented by my school. I am also the proud founder of Girls Who Code at North Lincoln High School and helped assist another Girls Who Code at a local school for middle schoolers. At Appalachian State University I am very busy. I am a part of multiple clubs including, campus cooks, women in computer science, Student Art League, Delight, and Women of Appropriate Technology. As a hobby I also enjoy doing makeup, I do people’s makeup for big and small events and run an Instagram account with over 5,000 followers. I use my platform and connect with beauty businesses and review their items and post honest reviews on my stories and page.
